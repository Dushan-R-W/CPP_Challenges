# C++ Student Management System


This project Implements a simple student management system. 
It allows to add a student, view student, search by ID, sort by ID, sort by name, save students to a .txt file and load saved data


# The project is structured into two main components:

**Student.cpp** - Process student data, save and load data to/from file
**Main.cpp** - Runs the management system  and allows the user to interact by introducing options. Also it's responsible for adding students, view students, search and sort
**studentData.txt**  - Holds an example of what saved data looks like.

# Example of options available:

1. Add student
2. View Student
3. Search by ID
