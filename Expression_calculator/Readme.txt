# C++ Expression Parser

This project implements a simple mathematical expression parser in C++.  
The program tokenizes and evaluates arithmetic expressions containing numbers, parentheses, and basic operators (+, -, *, /).

The project is structured into three main components:

- **Lexer** – Converts raw input text into tokens (numbers, operators, parentheses)
- **Parser** – Processes tokens and calculates the expression in the correct order
- **Main program** – Runs the lexer and parser on a sample expression and prints the result


Example input:
12 + 34 * (5 - 2) + (8 * 5 - 10)

Output:
Answer: 144
